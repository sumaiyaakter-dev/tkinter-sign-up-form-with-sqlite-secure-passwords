# Tkinter Sign-Up Form with SQLite & Secure Passwords

🚀 Upgraded my Tkinter Sign-Up Form into a fully functional application with a connected SQLite database and secure password storage.

✨ Key Features:
• Secure Data Storage: Saves user information to a local SQLite database.
• Password Security: Uses bcrypt hashing instead of storing plain-text passwords — a critical step for any real-world app.
• Full Backend Integration: Covers the complete process from designing the GUI to managing data on the backend.

💡 Small projects like this help build practical, real-world coding skills.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – For the graphical user interface
